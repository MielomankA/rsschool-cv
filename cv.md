I have no experience in programming.

My main education has nothing to do with programming. The first degree is in the field of agronomy, the second degree is in economics. I was educated at the graduate and post-graduate in agronomy. In the process of my programming education, I took courses SoloLearn, Stepik, studied available Internet resources.
